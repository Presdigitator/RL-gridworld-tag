Wrote these a while ago and just added them to github. Currently not well organised.

## Video

This video visualises a sample of the behaviour of the agents after a significant number of training episodes (video rendered from actual episode data)\
The particular episode visualised here is from a "honeypot" task environment (one of the several different ones I set up). The green agent gets reward for being on the green square (the 'honeypot'), the yellow agent gets reward for 'catching' the green agent.
