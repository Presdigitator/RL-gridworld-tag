Wrote these a while ago and just added them to github. Currently not well organised.

## Video

Here's a video that visualises an episode playthrough after agents have been trained (video rendered from actual episode data)\
This particular episode is from a "honeypot" task environment (one of the several different ones I set up). The green agent gets reward for being on the green square (the 'honeypot'), the yellow agent gets reward for 'catching' the green agent.
